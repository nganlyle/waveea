I am an infectious diseases physician. After many years in clinical practice I completed a Master in Data Science. Then I spent one year working as a research fellow at [OUCRU](www.oucru.org) investigating the use of wearables for the management of dengue. So I've been bitten by the bug - actually at least two bugs. The technology bug - which has made me less skeptical of the machine. And the global bug - which is a fuel for the heart.
