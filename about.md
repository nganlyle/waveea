I am an infectious diseases physician. After many years in clinical practice I completed a Master in Data Science. Then I spent one year working as a research fellow at [OUCRU](www.oucru.org) investigating the use of wearables for the management of dengue. It's been an eye opening journey that has made me less skeptical of the machine and more attuned to the possibility of change.
